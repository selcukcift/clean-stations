  - Login functionality using NextAuth.js instead of custom JWT
  - Session management working correctly
  - Missing: Dedicated logout endpoint, `/api/v1/auth/me` endpoint

- **Order Management** (`/api/orders/*`)
  - Order creation and retrieval implemented
  - Status updates functional
  - BOM generation integrated
  - Missing: Standardized API versioning (`/api/v1/`), pagination metadata

- **QC System** (`/api/orders/[orderId]/qc/*`)
  - QC form submission and retrieval working
  - Template management partially implemented
  - Missing: Dedicated `/api/v1/qc/*` endpoints

#### Missing/Incomplete Endpoints ❌
1. **Inventory Management** (`/api/v1/inventory/*`)
   - No dedicated inventory endpoints
   - Parts and assemblies data served through Node.js backend

2. **Assembly & Tasks** (`/api/v1/assembly/*`)

4. **Service Department** (`/api/v1/service/*`)
   - Partially implemented service order endpoints
   - Missing parts browsing functionality

5. **Standardized Response Format**

   - Missing metadata and error standardization

### 1.2 API Structure Gaps

```typescript
// Specified format (not implemented):
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": any | null,
  "error": {
    "code": string,
    "message": string,
    "details": any
  } | null,
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": string,
    "pagination": {...}
  }
}

// Current implementation varies:
// Sometimes returns raw data
// Inconsistent error handling
```

### 1.3 Recommendations
1. Implement API versioning strategy

## 12. Conclusion

The Torvan Medical CleanStation implementation has made significant progress on core functionality, particularly in order creation, BOM generation, and basic QC workflows. However, several critical areas require attention before the system can be considered production-ready.

### Key Strengths
- Solid foundation with modern tech stack
- Core order workflow functional
- Good component architecture
- Flexible development approach

### Critical Gaps
- Incomplete feature implementation (48% missing)
- Insufficient testing coverage
- Missing deployment infrastructure
- Security and compliance concerns

### Overall Recommendation
The project requires an estimated **6-8 additional weeks** of focused development to reach production readiness, with emphasis on:
1. Completing core features
2. Implementing comprehensive testing
3. Addressing security and compliance
4. Preparing deployment infrastructure

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
Without addressing the identified gaps, particularly in testing, security, and deployment readiness, the system poses significant risks for production use in a regulated medical device manufacturing environment.

## 12. Conclusion

The Torvan Medical CleanStation implementation has made significant progress on core functionality, particularly in order creation, BOM generation, and basic QC workflows. However, several critical areas require attention before the system can be considered production-ready.

### Key Strengths
- Solid foundation with modern tech stack
- Core order workflow functional
- Good component architecture
- Flexible development approach

### Critical Gaps
- Incomplete feature implementation (48% missing)
- Insufficient testing coverage
- Missing deployment infrastructure
- Security and compliance concerns

### Overall Recommendation
The project requires an estimated **6-8 additional weeks** of focused development to reach production readiness, with emphasis on:
1. Completing core features
2. Implementing comprehensive testing
3. Addressing security and compliance
4. Preparing deployment infrastructure

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
Without addressing the identified gaps, particularly in testing, security, and deployment readiness, the system poses significant risks for production use in a regulated medical device manufacturing environment.
