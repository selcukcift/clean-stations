# Coding Prompt Adherence Report

**Document Purpose:** This report details the adherence of the codebase to the "Coding Prompt Chains for Torvan Medical Workflow App Expansion (v5 - Hybrid Backend)" document (referred to as CPCv5).

**Date of Analysis:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Overall Summary:**
The codebase demonstrates a very high level of adherence to the CPCv5 document, especially for Phases 0 through 3, which establish the foundational architecture and core order workflow. Later chains (4-8) show significant implementation, Chain 9 is partially complete, and Chain 10 is not yet started. This aligns well with the "Development Status" section found in `README-NEW.md`. The project appears well-organized and follows the specified hybrid backend strategy effectively.

## Phase 0: Foundation Verification (Prompts 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence

*   **Prompt 0.1 (Update Project Documentation):**
    *   `README-NEW.md` comprehensively describes the hybrid architecture (Plain Node.js for core data/auth on port 3004, Next.js API Routes for order workflow/complex features on port 3005), project structure, and development status, aligning with CPCv5.
    *   **Observation:** The CPC document itself is named "...(v4 - ...).md" but its content and the README refer to it as "v5 - Hybrid Backend". The action to archive/rename the v4 document file mentioned in CPCv5 Prompt 0.1 does not appear to have been completed for the filename itself.

*   **Prompt 0.2 (Standardize Backend Ports & Refactor API Client):**
    *   **Ports:** Plain Node.js backend correctly defaults to and runs on port 3004. Next.js frontend/API routes correctly run on port 3005 (explicitly set in `package.json` scripts). This is confirmed in `src/config/environment.js`, `package.json`, and `.env.example`.
    *   **API Client (`lib/api.ts`):**
        *   `plainNodeApiClient` (baseURL `http://localhost:3004/api`) and `nextJsApiClient` (baseURL `/api`) are correctly implemented.
        *   A comment explicitly references CPCv5 for this setup.
        *   Frontend components use the correct clients: `app/login/page.tsx` uses `plainNodeApiClient`; `components/order/ConfigurationStep.tsx` and `components/order/AccessoriesStep.tsx` use `nextJsApiClient`.
        *   An interceptor (`attachAuthInterceptor`) correctly adds JWT tokens to requests from both clients.
    *   **`next.config.js` Rewrites:** The broad `/api/:path*` rewrite has been removed. A specific rewrite for `/api/auth/register` exists for development only; production has no such rewrites, aligning with the intent.
    *   `.env.example` reflects these port configurations.

*   **Prompt 0.3 (Implement Robust Authentication & Authorization for Next.js API Routes):**
    *   `lib/nextAuthUtils.ts` provides `getAuthUser` (extracts token from header or cookie, verifies JWT, fetches user from Prisma) and `checkUserRole` (checks user's role against allowed roles), fulfilling the prompt's requirements. It also includes a helpful `canAccessOrder` utility.
    *   Next.js API routes (e.g., `app/api/orders/route.ts`, `app/api/upload/route.ts`, `app/api/configurator/route.ts`, `app/api/accessories/route.ts`) use `getAuthUser` for authentication.
    *   Role-based authorization is implemented, either via `checkUserRole` or equivalent inline logic (e.g., in `GET /api/orders` for filtering, or `canAccessOrder` for specific order access).
    *   `JWT_SECRET` is present in `.env.example`.

## Phase 1: Solidify Chain 3 Backend (Prompts 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence

*   **Prompt 1.1 (Enhance and Finalize Order Management Next.js API Routes):**
    *   `app/api/orders/route.ts`:
        *   **POST (Create Order):** Uses Zod validation (`OrderCreateSchema`). Calls `src/services/bomService.js -> generateBOMForOrder` and creates `Bom`/`BomItem` records in a transaction. Creates related entities (`BasinConfiguration`, `FaucetConfiguration`, etc.) and `OrderHistoryLog`.
        *   **GET (List Orders):** Implements comprehensive role-based filtering, pagination, and deep population of specified relations.
    *   `app/api/orders/[orderId]/route.ts`:
        *   **GET (Get Order by ID):** Implements role-based access control using `canAccessOrder`. Deeply populates all specified relations (customer, BOM with items, history, configurations, documents).
    *   `app/api/orders/[orderId]/status/route.ts`:
        *   **PUT (Update Order Status):** Implements role-based authorization for status transitions via `validateStatusTransition` function. Validates `newStatus` with Zod. Updates `Order.status` and creates `OrderHistoryLog` in a Prisma transaction. Includes logic for sending notifications via `notificationService`.
    *   Error handling is robust across these routes.

*   **Prompt 1.2 (Enhance and Finalize File Upload Next.js API Route):**
    *   `app/api/upload/route.ts`:
        *   **POST Handler:** Implements robust file validation (MIME types, size limits - 10MB). Securely saves files to `uploads/documents/` with unique filenames. Creates `AssociatedDocument` record in Prisma with metadata and links to `orderId`.
        *   **DELETE Handler:** (In the same file, takes `documentId` as query param). Implements authentication and authorization (uploader or admin). Deletes the physical file and the `AssociatedDocument` record.
    *   Error handling is comprehensive.

*   **Prompt 1.3 (Deprecate Corresponding Plain Node.js Handlers):**
    *   `src/api/ordersHandlers.js` and `src/api/fileUploadHandlers.js` contain prominent deprecation comments at the top, correctly stating they are replaced by Next.js API Routes and referencing CPCv5.
    *   `src/lib/router.js` has the routes pointing to these deprecated handlers commented out, with comments indicating their new locations and referencing CPCv5.

## Phase 2: Dynamic Configurator & Accessories Logic (Prompts 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence

*   **Prompt 2.1 (Develop/Enhance `src/services/configuratorService.js`):**
    *   The service exists and implements functions like `getSinkModels`, `getLegTypes`, `getFeetTypes`, `getPegboardOptions`, `getBasinTypeOptions`, `getBasinSizeOptions`, `getBasinAddonOptions`, `getFaucetTypeOptions`, `getSprayerTypeOptions`, and `getControlBox`.
    *   It uses Prisma to validate/fetch key assemblies and implements business logic from "sink configuration and bom.txt". Some option lists are hardcoded (assumed to align with seeded data) while others involve direct Prisma interaction.
    *   Handles missing data and custom part number generation rules.

*   **Prompt 2.2 (Develop/Enhance `src/services/accessoriesService.js`):**
    *   The service exists and implements `getAccessoryCategories`, `getAccessoriesByCategory`, and `getAllAccessories` (with search, filtering, pagination).
    *   All data retrieval is done via Prisma, targeting assemblies under the 'ACCESSORY LIST' category ('720').
    *   Includes additional helpful functions like `getAccessoriesGroupedByCategory`, `getFeaturedAccessories`, and `getAccessoryDetails`.

*   **Prompt 2.3 (Refactor Configurator & Accessories Next.js API Routes):**
    *   `app/api/configurator/route.ts`: Imports and uses `configuratorService.js`. Parses `queryType` and other parameters to call appropriate service functions. Implements authentication using `getAuthUser`.
    *   `app/api/accessories/route.ts`: Imports and uses `accessoriesService.js`. Parses parameters (`categoryCode`, `featured`, `search`, etc.) to call appropriate service functions. Implements authentication using `getAuthUser`.

*   **Prompt 2.4 (Deprecate Corresponding Plain Node.js Configurator Handlers):**
    *   `src/api/configuratorHandlers.js` has a prominent deprecation comment at the top, correctly stating it's replaced by Next.js API Routes calling backend services, and references CPCv5.
    *   `src/lib/router.js` has the routes pointing to `configuratorHandlers.js` commented out with explanatory notes referencing CPCv5.

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration & Legacy Code Refinement (Prompts 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence

*   **Prompt 3.1 (Update Frontend Order Creation Steps for Dynamic Data):**
    *   `components/order/ConfigurationStep.tsx`: Correctly fetches dynamic data from `/api/configurator` using `nextJsApiClient`.
    *   `components/order/AccessoriesStep.tsx`: Correctly fetches dynamic data (categories, featured, by category, search results) from `/api/accessories` using `nextJsApiClient`.
    *   `stores/orderCreateStore.ts` (Zustand store): Structured to capture user selections from dynamic data (e.g., selected part numbers, assembly IDs, chosen options for configuration and accessories).

*   **Prompt 3.2 (Strategize Legacy JavaScript File Usage):**
    *   Legacy files (`app.js`, `sink-config.js`, `accessories.js`, `bom-generator.js`, `index.html`, `styles.css`) are present.
    *   `index.html` is the entry point for the legacy non-React application.
    *   A detailed strategy document, `docs/legacy_js_analysis.md`, exists. It recommends:
        *   **Safe to remove now:** `index.html`, `app.js`, `accessories.js`.
        *   **Remove after specific feature migration to Next.js app:**
            *   `sink-config.js`: After migrating "auto-selection of DI faucet for E_SINK_DI basin" to `ConfigurationStep.tsx`.
            *   `bom-generator.js`: After implementing "BOM display UI with tree", "CSV export", and "Edit configuration navigation" in `ReviewStep.tsx`.
    *   This strategy aligns with CPCv5's intent to phase out legacy code.

*   **Prompt 3.3 (Final Review of Frontend API Calls):**
    *   Frontend API calls correctly use either `plainNodeApiClient` or `nextJsApiClient` from `lib/api.ts` for their intended backends.
    *   JWT authentication tokens are correctly included in all requests made by these clients via an interceptor in `lib/api.ts`.

## Brief Check on Later Chains (4-10)

*   **Chain 4 (Role-Based Dashboards & Order Viewing):**
    *   **Status:** Significant Progress.
    *   `app/dashboard/page.tsx` exists and uses `useAuthStore` for role-based rendering of specific dashboard components (e.g., `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `ProductionCoordinatorDashboard.tsx`, etc., all of which exist in `components/dashboard/`). `app/orders/[orderId]/page.tsx` also exists.

*   **Chain 5 (Workflow State Management & Progression):**
    *   **Status:** Significant Progress.
    *   Order status transition logic and `OrderHistoryLog` are robust (verified in Phase 1).
    *   `Notification` model exists in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   `src/services/notificationService.js` and `app/api/notifications/route.ts` exist.
    *   `components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx` exists.

*   **Chain 6 (Production & QC Checklists):**
    *   **Status:** Very Significant Progress / Near Complete.
    *   Prisma models (`QcFormTemplate`, `QcFormTemplateItem`, `OrderQcResult`, `OrderQcItemResult`) are fully defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   API routes under `app/api/admin/qc-templates/` and `app/api/orders/[orderId]/qc/` appear to exist (based on `ls` structure).
    *   Frontend components like `components/admin/QCTemplateManager.tsx`, `components/qc/QCFormInterface.tsx`, and pages like `app/orders/[orderId]/qc/fill/page.tsx` appear to exist.

*   **Chain 7 (BOM Management & Reporting Enhancement):**
    *   **Status:** Plausible Progress.
    *   `components/order/BOMDisplay.tsx` exists.
    *   API for BOM export (`app/api/orders/[orderId]/bom/export`) is likely present within the Next.js API structure for orders but not explicitly confirmed from root `ls`.

*   **Chain 8 (UI/UX Refinement and Styling Consistency):**
    *   **Status:** Good Foundation.
    *   Consistent use of ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS is evident from project structure and component files.
    *   `framer-motion` is a dependency, suggesting animations are used.
    *   `useToast` and `Skeleton` components suggest good user feedback mechanisms.

*   **Chain 9 (Implementing Other Sink Families):**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented.
    *   `src/services/configuratorService.js` (`getSinkModels`) currently only details 'MDRD' and returns `[]` for other families.
    *   `README-NEW.md` confirms this: "Infrastructure for multiple sink families (60% complete); Configuration data for Endoscope CleanStation and InstoSink [is missing]; Remove 'Under Construction' messages for non-MDRD families [is pending]".

*   **Chain 10 (Service Department Workflow):**
    *   **Status:** Not Implemented.
    *   Prisma models (`ServiceOrder`, `ServiceOrderItem`) are missing from `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   Associated API routes (`app/api/service-orders/`) and frontend pages (`app/service-orders/`) are missing.
    *   `README-NEW.md` confirms this status.

## Identified Gaps / Incomplete Items (as per CPCv5 and `legacy_js_analysis.md`):

1.  **CPC Document Naming:** The filename of the "Coding Prompt Chains" document itself (`...v4...`) should be updated to reflect its v5 content as per its own instructions.
2.  **Legacy JS Migration Gaps (from `docs/legacy_js_analysis.md`):**
    *   `sink-config.js`: Auto-selection of DI faucet for E_SINK_DI basins needs to be implemented in `ConfigurationStep.tsx` before this legacy file can be fully removed.
    *   `bom-generator.js`: BOM display UI (hierarchical tree), CSV export, and "Edit Configuration" navigation from BOM review need to be implemented in `ReviewStep.tsx` (or equivalent Next.js component) before this legacy file can be fully removed.
3.  **Chain 9 (Other Sink Families):**
    *   Configuration data (parts, assemblies, rules) for "Endoscope CleanStation" and "InstoSink" needs to be added to `src/services/configuratorService.js` and potentially seeded into the database.
    *   Frontend UI (`SinkSelectionStep.tsx`, `ConfigurationStep.tsx`) needs to be updated to fully support these families and remove any "Under Construction" messages.
4.  **Chain 10 (Service Department Workflow):** This entire chain is pending implementation (Prisma models, APIs, UI).

## Recommendations:

1.  Rename the "Coding Prompt Chains for Torvan Medical Workflow App Expansion (v4 - ...).md" file to reflect its v5 content and archive the original v4 if distinct.
2.  Prioritize completing the identified migration gaps for `sink-config.js` and `bom-generator.js` to allow for the full removal of legacy client-side JavaScript files.
3.  Address the implementation of Chain 9 (Other Sink Families) by adding the necessary data and updating UI components.
4.  Plan and implement Chain 10 (Service Department Workflow) as a new feature set.
5.  Conduct a thorough review of the "Brief Check" items for Chains 4-8 to ensure full functionality as per CPCv5 prompts for those chains. While they show significant progress, a detailed check was outside the scope of this phase of analysis.

This report is based on static analysis of the codebase against the provided CPCv5 document.
