## Slide 1: Welcome to Digital QC
### Transition from Paper to Digital

**What's Changed**:
- Paper checklists → Digital templates
- Manual signatures → Digital signatures  
- Static forms → Conditional logic
- File storage → Real-time database

**What Stays the Same**:
- Same quality standards
- Same inspection rigor
- Same compliance requirements
- Same attention to detail

## Slide 2: System Overview
### Digital QC Architecture

```
Order Creation → Parts Arrival → Pre-QC → Production → Final QC → Shipping
      ↓              ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓         ↓
   Planning    Procurement   ✅ QC     Assembly   ✅ QC    Delivery
```

**Your Role**: Quality gatekeeper at critical production phases

## Slide 3: QC Templates Overview
### From Paper to Digital

| Paper Document | Digital Template | Phase |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| CLP.T2.001.V01 Section 1 | Pre-Production Check | Before production |
| CLP.T2.001.V01 Section 2 | Production Check | During assembly |
| CLP.T2.001.V01 Section 3 | Basin Production Check | Basin installation |
| CLQ.T2.001.V01 | Final Quality Check | Before shipping |
| CLT.T2.001.V01 | End-of-Line Testing | Comprehensive test |

**Total**: 6 templates, 194 checklist items

---

## Slide 4: Smart Conditional Logic
### Only See What Matters

**Example 1: Pegboard Configuration**
- Order WITH pegboard → Shows pegboard inspection items
- Order WITHOUT pegboard → Hides pegboard items (auto N/A)

**Example 2: Basin Types**
- E-Drain basin → Shows drainage-specific checks
- E-Sink basin → Shows faucet and sink-specific checks

**Result**: Faster inspections, fewer errors, less confusion

---

## Slide 5: Digital Signature & Compliance
### ISO 13485:2016 Compliance

**Digital Signature Components**:
- Inspector name (full legal name)
- Timestamp (automatic)
- User ID (automatic)
- Template version (automatic)

**Audit Trail**:
- Cannot be modified after submission
- Permanently stored in database
- Available for regulatory inspection
- Linked to order history

## Slide 8: Item Types Deep Dive
### How to Complete Different Item Types

**PASS_FAIL**: Most common
- ✅ Pass = Component meets requirements
- ❌ Fail = Component has defects/issues

**TEXT_INPUT**: Specific values
- Job IDs: "TOR-2025-001"
- Measurements: "48.5 inches"
- Serial numbers: "LED-12345"

**SINGLE_SELECT**: One choice
- Leg types: "Lock & levelling castors"
- Faucet types: "Wrist blade 10in"

**MULTI_SELECT**: Multiple choices
- Addons: ["P-trap", "Basin light", "Dosing port"]

## Slide 9: Quality Failure Handling
### When Things Don't Pass

**Failed Item Process**:
1. **Mark as FAILED** in checklist
2. **Add detailed notes** about the issue
3. **Take photos** if applicable
4. **Continue inspection** for other items
5. **Set overall status to FAILED**
6. **Submit with notes**

**Post-Failure Actions**:
- Order status remains unchanged
- Production team notified immediately
- Corrective action required
- Re-inspection after fixes
