# PRD Adherence Report: Torvan Medical CleanStation Production Workflow Digitalization

**Document Purpose:** This report details the adherence of the codebase to the Product Requirements Document "Torvan Medical CleanStation Production Workflow Digitalization.md" (Version 1.1, referred to as PRD).

**Date of Analysis:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Overall Summary:**
The codebase exhibits strong alignment with many core aspects of the PRD, particularly in user role definitions, the main order creation and management workflow, foundational data models for products and orders, and the quality control (QC) system. Key UI/UX technology choices also match the PRD. However, there are notable gaps, primarily concerning detailed assembly guidance (task lists, work instructions, tools), specific testing modules, and the Service Department workflow, which are designated as later phase implementations or not yet started, consistent with both the PRD's phased approach and the project's current development status as noted in `README-NEW.md`.

## 1. User Roles & Permissions (PRD Section 3)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence

*   The `UserRole` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma` perfectly matches all roles defined in PRD Section 3: `ADMIN`, `PRODUCTION_COORDINATOR`, `PROCUREMENT_SPECIALIST`, `QC_PERSON`, `ASSEMBLER`, `SERVICE_DEPARTMENT`.
*   API routes and frontend components (dashboards) show evidence of role-based logic and views, aligning with the responsibilities and access levels described for each role in the PRD. For example, `app/api/orders/route.ts` customizes data visibility by role, and `components/dashboard/` contains role-specific dashboard components.

## 2. Core Features (PRD Section 4 - User Stories)

**Status:** Good Adherence for In-Scope Items; Gaps for Future Phases/Detailed Items

*   **UC 1.x: Order Creation & Configuration:**
    *   **UC 1.1 (5-Step Wizard):** High level of implementation. Frontend components (`CustomerInfoStep.tsx`, `SinkSelectionStep.tsx`, etc.), `OrderCreateStore.ts`, backend services (`configuratorService.js`, `accessoriesService.js`), and APIs (`/api/orders`, `/api/upload`) support this.
    *   **UC 1.2 (View/Manage Orders):** High level of implementation. APIs and dashboard components exist.
    *   **UC 1.3 (Update Order Status to "Shipped"):** Implemented via generic status update API.
    *   **UC 1.4 (Standard Manuals in BOM):** Partially implemented. `bomService.js` adds standard language-based manual kits. Logic for *additional* configuration-specific IFUs (e.g., IFU.T2.ESinkInstUserFR) is not apparent in `bomService.js`.
*   **UC 2.x: BOM Management:**
    *   **UC 2.1 (Auto-Generate BOM):** High level of implementation by `bomService.js`. However, inclusion of specific "Standard Packaging & Kits" items from CLP.T2.001.V01 Section 4 into the BOM is not explicitly visible in `bomService.js` unless these are part of predefined assemblies.
    *   **UC 2.2 (View BOM):** Likely implemented (`BOMDisplay.tsx` exists).
    *   **UC 2.3 (Export/Share BOM):** Partially implemented. Backend API for CSV export seems plausible; PDF is future. Frontend trigger for CSV was noted as a potential gap in `legacy_js_analysis.md`.
*   **UC 3.x: Procurement Workflow:**
    *   Basic order review and status updates (UC 3.1, 3.3, 3.4) are likely covered by existing order management features and `ProcurementSpecialistDashboard.tsx`.
    *   **Gap:** UC 3.2 (Manage Parts for Outsourcing) - No specific features for this are evident.
    *   **Gap:** UC 3.5 (Manage Service Part Orders) - Not implemented (aligns with Chain 10/Phase 4 status).
*   **UC 4.x: QC Workflow:**
    *   **UC 4.1 (Pre-QC) & UC 4.2 (Final QC):** High level of implementation. `QCPersonDashboard.tsx`, detailed Prisma models for QC templates/results (aligning with CLP.T2.001.V01), and relevant API/frontend components exist.
*   **UC 5.x: Assembly Workflow:**
    *   Basic order assignment (UC 5.1) and status updates (UC 5.6) seem covered.
    *   **Gap:** UC 5.2 (Tailored Assembly Guidance based on CLP.T2.001.V01), UC 5.3 (Task Completion Tracking) - Data models for detailed, checklist-integrated assembly task lists are not apparent.
    *   **Gap:** UC 5.4 (Perform & Record Testing) - Specific data models for testing forms/results are not apparent.
    *   Packaging checklist items (UC 5.5 / CLP Section 4) in BOM - see UC 2.1.
*   **UC 6.x: Service Department Workflow:**
    *   **Gap:** UC 6.1 (Browse/Order Service Parts) - Not implemented (aligns with Chain 10/Phase 4 status).
*   **UC 7.x: Data & System Management (Admin):**
    *   Management of Parts, Assemblies, Categories (UC 7.1) likely exists via core APIs.
    *   QC Checklist Template management (UC 7.2) appears well-implemented.
    *   QR Code generation support (UC 7.3) exists (`qrData` field in `Assembly`).
    *   User Management (UC 7.4) basics are likely via Admin role, specific UI not confirmed.
    *   **Gap:** Detailed data models and management interfaces for Work Instructions, Task Lists, and Tools (part of UC 7.2) are not apparent.
*   **UC 8.x: General System Features:**
    *   Auth, Role-Based Dashboards, Search/Filter, Notifications, Document Management (UC 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5) show high levels of implementation.

## 3. Data Model / Database Pools (PRD Section 5)

**Status:** Good Adherence for Core Entities; Gaps for Specific Modules

*   **Orders Pool (PRD 5.1):** Good alignment. `Order` model and related configuration tables in `prisma/schema.prisma` are comprehensive.
*   **Inventory Pool (PRD 5.2 - Parts, Assemblies, Categories):** Good alignment. `Part`, `Assembly`, `AssemblyComponent`, `Category`, `Subcategory` models are well-defined.
*   **Bill of Materials (BOMs) Pool (PRD 5.3):** Good alignment. `Bom` and `BomItem` models support hierarchical structure.
*   **Users Pool (PRD 5.7):** Good alignment. `User` model matches PRD fields.
*   **QC Forms/Checklists Pool (PRD 5.8) & QC Results Pool (PRD 5.9):** Excellent alignment. Prisma models are detailed and match PRD.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   **Work Instructions Pool (PRD 5.4):** Not explicitly defined in detail in Prisma schema.
    *   **Task Lists Pool (PRD 5.5):** Not explicitly defined, crucial for UC 5.2 (Guided Assembly).
    *   **Tools Pool (PRD 5.6):** Not explicitly defined.
    *   **Testing Forms & Results Pool (PRD 5.10):** Not explicitly defined.
    *   **Service Orders Pool (PRD 5.11):** Not implemented (models `ServiceOrder`, `ServiceOrderItem` missing).

## 4. Workflow Logic (PRD Section 4 - Statuses)

**Status:** Good Adherence for Core Order Workflow

*   The `OrderStatus` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma` aligns with statuses mentioned in the PRD.
*   The API route `app/api/orders/[orderId]/status/route.ts` implements role-based validation for transitions between these statuses.
*   `OrderHistoryLog` captures these changes.
*   Workflows *within* a specific stage (e.g., detailed assembly task progression, specific QC item check-offs driving overall QC status) are dependent on the data models identified as gaps (Task Lists, detailed Testing Results).

## 5. UI/UX Requirements (PRD Section 6.2)

**Status:** Good Foundation

*   The technology choices (Next.js, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide icons) directly match PRD Section 6.1 and support the UI/UX goals of Section 6.2.
*   The project structure and components (`components/ui/`, dashboard layouts) indicate an effort towards the described modern, dashboard-style interface.
*   A detailed visual and interactive review would be needed to fully assess adherence to the nuanced UI/UX guidelines, but the technical foundation is appropriate.

## 6. Reporting Requirements (PRD UC 2.3)

**Status:** Partially Implemented

*   PRD UC 2.3 (BOM Export): Backend API for CSV export is plausible. PDF export is noted as future. The frontend trigger for CSV export was identified as a potential item to be migrated from legacy code.

## 7. Out of Scope / Future Phases

*   The codebase correctly reflects items listed as "Out of Scope" (PRD Section 7) or for future phases (PRD Section 1.3, Section 10 for Phased Implementation):
    *   No direct integration with sales/quoting.
    *   Functionality for "Endoscope CleanStation" and "InstroSink" is minimal (consistent with `configuratorService.js` and `README-NEW.md`).
    *   Service Department workflow (Chain 10 / PRD Phase 4) is not implemented.

## Key Gaps & Recommendations Based on PRD:

1.  **Detailed Assembly Guidance (UC 5.2, PRD 5.5 - Task Lists):**
    *   **Gap:** Missing explicit data models for `Task Lists` that integrate work instructions, parts, tools, and specific checklist items from CLP.T2.001.V01.
    *   **Recommendation:** Define and implement Prisma models for `TaskList`, `Task`, and related entities. Develop services and UI to deliver this tailored guidance to Assemblers.
2.  **Specific Testing Modules (UC 5.4, PRD 5.10 - Testing Forms & Results):**
    *   **Gap:** Missing data models for "Testing Forms & Results".
    *   **Recommendation:** Define Prisma models for testing templates and results, similar to the QC system but tailored for functional tests. Implement associated APIs and UI.
3.  **Work Instructions & Tools Data Management (UC 7.2, PRD 5.4, 5.6):**
    *   **Gap:** Missing explicit data models for `WorkInstruction` and `Tool`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Define these models in Prisma. Develop Admin interfaces for managing this data.
4.  **Service Department Workflow (UC 3.5, UC 6.x, PRD 5.11):**
    *   **Gap:** Entire module not implemented (Prisma models, APIs, UI).
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement as per PRD Phase 4 / Chain 10.
5.  **BOM Enhancements:**
    *   **Gap (UC 1.4):** Logic for including *configuration-specific* IFU documents in the BOM (beyond the standard language manual) appears missing from `bomService.js`.
    *   **Gap (UC 2.1/5.5):** Explicit inclusion of "Standard Packaging & Kits" items from CLP.T2.001.V01 Section 4 into the BOM is not apparent in `bomService.js` unless part of higher-level assemblies.
    *   **Gap (UC 2.3):** Frontend trigger for CSV export of BOM.
    *   **Recommendation:** Review and enhance `bomService.js` to cover these specific item inclusions. Implement the frontend CSV export functionality.
6.  **Parts for Outsourcing (UC 3.2):**
    *   **Gap:** No clear features for identifying or tracking parts for outsourcing.
    *   **Recommendation:** Evaluate requirements and implement necessary data fields/UI if this is a priority.

This report should provide a clear overview of how the current codebase aligns with the PRD.
