## 11. Conclusion and Recommendations

### 11.1 Overall Risk Assessment

The Torvan Medical CleanStation Production Workflow Digitalization project presents a **MEDIUM-HIGH** overall risk profile, with several high-priority risks requiring immediate attention and careful management. While no critical risks have been identified, the combination of complex technical requirements, business process changes, and compliance obligations creates a challenging risk environment.

### 11.2 Key Recommendations

   - Implement weekly risk review process
   - Create risk escalation procedures

2. **Address High-Priority Technical Risks**
   - Begin BOM generation logic design and testing framework
   - Establish data migration testing environment
   - Implement performance monitoring strategy

3. **Strengthen Change Management**
   - Formalize requirement change control process
   - Begin user engagement and training planning
   - Establish clear project scope boundaries

#### Medium-Term Actions (Next 90 Days)
1. **Security and Compliance Framework**
   - Engage ISO 13485 compliance consultant
   - Implement comprehensive security controls
   - Establish audit trail and documentation systems

2. **Operational Readiness**
   - Develop business continuity plans
   - Establish support and maintenance procedures
   - Create disaster recovery capabilities

#### Long-Term Monitoring (Ongoing)
1. **Continuous Risk Assessment**
   - Regular risk register updates
   - Emerging risk identification
   - Mitigation effectiveness measurement

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Key risk indicator tracking
   - Trend analysis and forecasting
