# Coding Prompt Adherence Report

**Document Purpose:** This report details the adherence of the codebase to the "Coding Prompt Chains for Torvan Medical Workflow App Expansion (v5 - Hybrid Backend)" document (referred to as CPCv5).

**Date of Analysis:** June 2, 2025

**Overall Summary:**
The codebase demonstrates **EXCELLENT** adherence to the CPCv5 document across all phases. Phases 0 through 3 maintain their excellent implementation, while Chains 4-8 show complete or near-complete implementation. **Chain 9 and Chain 10 are now FULLY IMPLEMENTED** as of this update. All identified gaps from the previous analysis have been resolved, and all legacy migration tasks have been completed successfully.

## Phase 0: Foundation Verification (Prompts 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence ✅

*   **Prompt 0.1 (Update Project Documentation):**
    *   `README-NEW.md` comprehensively describes the hybrid architecture (Plain Node.js for core data/auth on port 3001, Next.js API Routes for order workflow/complex features on port 3005), project structure, and development status, aligning with CPCv5.
    *   **RESOLVED:** The CPC document filename has been updated from "v4" to "v5" to match its content.

*   **Prompt 0.2 (Standardize Backend Ports & Refactor API Client):**
    *   **Ports:** Plain Node.js backend correctly defaults to and runs on port 3001. Next.js frontend/API routes correctly run on port 3005 (explicitly set in `package.json` scripts). Updated from previous port 3004 to 3001.
    *   **API Client (`lib/api.ts`):**
        *   `plainNodeApiClient` (baseURL `http://localhost:3001/api`) and `nextJsApiClient` (baseURL `/api`) are correctly implemented.
        *   A comment explicitly references CPCv5 for this setup.
        *   Frontend components use the correct clients consistently across the application.
        *   An interceptor (`attachAuthInterceptor`) correctly adds JWT tokens to requests from both clients.
    *   **`next.config.js` Rewrites:** Properly configured for hybrid backend architecture.
    *   `.env.example` reflects these port configurations.

*   **Prompt 0.3 (Implement Robust Authentication & Authorization for Next.js API Routes):**
    *   `lib/nextAuthUtils.ts` provides comprehensive authentication and authorization utilities.
    *   All Next.js API routes implement proper authentication and role-based authorization.
    *   JWT handling is secure and consistent across the application.

## Phase 1: Solidify Chain 3 Backend (Prompts 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)

**Status:** Excellent Adherence ✅

*   **Prompt 1.1 (Enhance and Finalize Order Management Next.js API Routes):**
    *   All order management routes are fully implemented with comprehensive validation, error handling, and role-based access control.
    *   **NEW:** Added PUT `/api/orders/[orderId]` for order configuration editing with full transaction support and BOM regeneration.

*   **Prompt 1.2 (Enhance and Finalize File Upload Next.js API Route):**
    *   File upload functionality is robust and secure with proper validation and cleanup.

*   **Prompt 1.3 (Deprecate Corresponding Plain Node.js Handlers):**
    *   All deprecation comments are in place and legacy handlers are properly marked.

## Phase 2: Dynamic Configurator & Accessories Logic (Prompts 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)
